# Project 4

## Project Overview

In this project you will use k-nearest neighbors to predict heart disease in patients and also to predict a variable in a dataset of your choice.

## Dataset Descriptions

### Part 1

`Cleveland Dataset`: features columns such as age, sex, chest pain cholesterol, etc. It also shows what patients have been diagnosed with heart disease 0 if no, 1,2,3,4 if yes.  
`Student Dropout Dataset`: features columns such as age at enrollment, whether or not the student is a scholarship holder, and so on, ultimately showing whether or not the student has dropped out of school.

### Part 2

`Predict Students Dropout and Academic Success`: A [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies.

## File Structure

- `project4.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for this project.

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python (version 3.x or above) and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.
4. Add a `datasets` folder to the main directory.
5. Add in the datasets

- You will need the `cleveland.csv`, `cleveland-test-sample.csv`, and `data.csv` from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)

## Usage

- Open the `project4.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS code to view the analysis.
- The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis.
- You can modify and rerun the code cells to explore different hypotheses or perspectives.

## Analysis Techniques

Each technique is demonstrated with appropriate visualizations using Seaborn and/or Matplotlib.
